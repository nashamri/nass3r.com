I'm running openbox right now on my arch installation on my Thinkpad X240 and I wanted a lightweight GTK battery indicator that sits in the systray. I found a small little application called "tidybattery" here tidybattery_ but it didn't work well with my dual battery system. So I forked the application, made my modifications, and in the good free software spirit, posted my modification back to the same forum thread.

I changed the name of the application to dualtidy and it can be found in the AUR_.
