If you want to write Arabic in vim, there's a small option that sets the
direction of the page to right-to-left and lets you write Arabic with no
problems :D

The option is:

.. code:: vim

    :set arabic

And to turn it off, type:

.. code:: vim

    :set noarabic

Here's a small screenshot of vim with Arabic working just fine!
