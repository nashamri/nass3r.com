I have my galaxy SII withÂ Cyanogenmod 10.1 and I got this message
"Storage space running out some system functions may not work". I tried
to uninstall some applications but that didn't do the trick. I only had
like 100MB of free space. Then I found that there are like 1.8Gigs of
log files stored in the /data/log directory which I don't really care
about.

So in order to free some space, I ran the following commands from the
terminal:

.. code:: brush:

    $ su -
    $ cd /data/log
    $ rm *.log

| It'll ask for root permissions when u run the first line.
|  Hope this helps!
